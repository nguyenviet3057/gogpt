Currently, the group consists of 01 member: [*Viet Nguyen Quoc*](https://www.facebook.com/nguyenviet3057/). We eagerly look forward to expanding the team in the long run.\n\nThe **GoGPT** project is built upon the original [*BetterGPT project by Jing Hua*](https://github.com/ztjhz/BetterChatGPT) (an extension UI of [*OpenAI's ChatGPT*](https://chat.openai.com/)), simplified and enhanced with the feature of generating images from text. The project encompasses two main functionalities: a Chatbot utilizing the OpenAI API with the GPT-3.5-turbo model, and an AI Art feature using the Stable Diffusion model (SDXL 1.0 base).\nAnticipated upcoming features include: Generating music/sound from text; Creating scripts from text; and more.\n\nWe are eager to receive feedback and contributions from all of you!",
